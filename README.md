## General Information
- The project is to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has faced significant revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is struggling to sustain itself in the current market. To accelerate revenue post-lockdown, they aim to understand the future demand for shared bikes and prepare a strategic business plan to meet customer needs and outperform competitors
- The dataset consist of data of bike sharing data  since 2018 to 2019

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Bike sharing increased from 2018 to 2019
- Demand increases in the month of September and during the 'Fall' season
- Rainly/Snow wheather also adversly impacting the business
